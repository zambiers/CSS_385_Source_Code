# Program 2 Interaction Model

My two interactions are combat with enemy and collecting items. Emeies will spawn at random and, are supposed to, deal
damage to the player. Orignally, I wanted to have enemies drop the items that must be collected. However, that system became problematic,
so I went with spreading the collcting items around the map, and just have the enemies try to attack you when player is in sight.

This type of model can be used in different parts of games to level up the player as they progress, allowing them to
become stronger. It gives the player guidence for what they must do and, in some games, how to defeat the boss.
